# Reinforcement

This is basically a matrix maze game by implementing Reinforcement Learning. The features/logic of the game are as follows:-
1. In any maze matrix desired by the user, an agent has to start at initial point and traverse the maze(environment) upto the destination.
2. If multiple paths exist from initial to final destination, the agent will prefer the path that yields the maximum reward.
